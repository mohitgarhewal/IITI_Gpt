## 1. Introduction

IITI-GPT is a full-stack + ML prototype designed to help students at IITI get accurate answers to their questions about the institute. It provides a conversational AI interface with chat logging and optional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) support, built for fast experimentation and easy deployment.

## Project Aim

The main goal of IITI-GPT is to resolve students‚Äô queries related to IITI‚Äîwhether about academics, campus facilities, events, or procedures‚Äîby using intelligent AI agents. When a student asks a question, the system:

1. **Reasons**: The AI agent analyzes the question to understand its intent and context.
2. **Plans**: It determines the best approach to find the answer, including which sources to consult and how to structure the response.
3. **Executes**: The agent retrieves relevant information from trusted documents and databases, filters out noise, and synthesizes a clear, accurate answer.

This process ensures that students receive reliable, context-aware responses quickly and conveniently on their mobile devices.

### How AI Agents Work

- **Reasoning Agent**: Interprets the user‚Äôs question, identifies key topics, and decides what information is needed.
- **Planning Agent**: Chooses the most relevant sources (such as official IITI documents or FAQs), organizes the search, and outlines the answer.
- **Execution Agent**: Fetches data, applies filters to ensure accuracy and relevance, and generates a concise, user-friendly response.

By combining these agents, IITI-GPT delivers high-quality answers tailored to each student‚Äôs needs, making campus information accessible and actionable.

**Quick summary**
- **Architecture:** React (UI) ‚Üî FastAPI (Backend) ‚Üî ML Inference Service. Postgres for persistence, Redis for cache/pubsub, S3/MinIO for assets.
- **Data model (core):** `users`, `chats`, `messages`, `interaction_logs` (JSONB for flexible metadata).
- **Components:** UI ¬∑ Auth ¬∑ API ¬∑ Inference ¬∑ Storage ¬∑ DB ¬∑ Cache.
- **Tech choices (short):**
  - **React + TypeScript** ‚Äî rapid UI + type safety
  - **FastAPI (Python)** ‚Äî async, ML-friendly
  - **PyTorch / Transformers** ‚Äî standard for conversational models
  - **Postgres + JSONB** ‚Äî reliable + flexible fields
  - **Redis** ‚Äî low-latency cache / pubsub

## 4. How the System Works

- **Student asks a question** via the chat interface (web or mobile).
- **AI agents reason, plan, and execute**:
  - The reasoning agent interprets the query and identifies what information is needed.
  - The planning agent selects trusted sources (IITI docs, FAQs, official announcements) and decides how to answer.
  - The execution agent retrieves, filters, and synthesizes the best possible answer.
- **Response delivered instantly** to the student, with chat history logged for future reference.
- **Mobile-first design** ensures answers are accessible anywhere, anytime.
